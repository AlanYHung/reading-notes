### Summary
* Classes are reference type variables that are used to create objects.
* Classes are capable of inheriting the properties and methods of other classes
* Constructors are methods that have the same name as it's type.
* Constructors are used to help instantiate instances of new Objects.
* Constructors can be static to initialize static fields with values.
* Properties are class members that provide the mechanisms for reading, writing, and/or computing the private fields in a class.
* There can be multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.  This is called Overloading.
* Deconstructors reset an instance of an object back to base form.
* C# has auto-implemented properties
* Class properties use get accessors and setter accessors.
* Stack memory keeps track of the order of how code is executed
* Heap memory keeps track of data and can be accessed in any order.
* Garbage Collection is the act of allocating and freeing up memory space.
* This is important so that your program does not use all the RAM of a computer and lower the performance of the computer's OS.
* C# provides automated garbage collection, but it is important to understand it in order to write the most efficient program.
