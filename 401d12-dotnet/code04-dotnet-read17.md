### Summary
* Razer is an alternate way of building server side web applications to MVC
* The reason you would use razer over MVC is that Razer is more friendly to beginning developers.
* Razer is also more efficient when building web apps on a smaller scale than MVC where you do not need controllers and models to be in different classes.
* Razer is currently a new addition to .NET and will probably get better over time, but MVC has been around longer and so has been more fully fleshed out in it's implementation.
