### Summary
* Binary Trees are linked lists where every node has a 2 Next Nodes labeled left and right.
* The top node or head node of a Binary tree is called the Root Node.
* The reference nodes (next nodes) are referred to as Edge in trees
* The lowest level children nodes in a tree that do not have any children of their own are called leaf nodes
* The height of a tree is calculated by the number of links (edges) between the root and bottom most node (leaf)
* There are 2 categories for traversing a tree:
  * Depth First:  Prioritizes going through the depth of a tree first
  * Breadth First:  Prioritizes going through each level of the tree first
