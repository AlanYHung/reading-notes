* Linked Lists are data structures that contain the properties of values and one or more pointers
* Pointers are variables the reference the address of connected nodes.
* Generally pointers will point to the next node or previous nodes.
* When traversing a Linked List you always have to start at the beginning and go through each connected Node.
* Big O efficiency is usually O(n) and/or O(1)

* Linked Lists are linear data structures meaning you have to traverse every node to get to the value you want to access or add in most cases.
* The difference between Linked Lists and arrays is the way it handles memory.
  * Linked Lists can be stored anywhere in memory as they will always point to the next and/or previous node in their list.
  * Arrays require a block of contiguous memory of the size required to be available in memory.

* Adding new items to the list is simple with linked lists because there is no need to pre-allocate memory.
* Once a new item is added to the list, you just need to rearrange the pointers
* The advantage of linked lists is the dynamic memory management and the speed at which you can add or remove elements.
* The disadvantage of linkedlists is that it is slow to search for a specific item in the list.
* Following is a list of pros and cons between Linked Lists and Arrays.
