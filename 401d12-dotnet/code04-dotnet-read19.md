### Summary
* When an identity is created, it can be assigned one or more claims
  * The claims are key value pairs that determine what a user can or cannot do
* Authentication and Authorization is determined when a user is created
  * Authentication determines who the user is
  * Authorization determins what the user can do
    * Authorization can be changed over time after the registration of a user
* There are 3 parts to a JWT Token
  * First part is the Header - This determines what Signature will be used
  * Second part is the Payload - This contains the claims
  * Third part is the Signature - This is the encryption
* When using JWT Tokens, there needs to be communication between Producers and Consumers
  * Producers are the service providers while consumers are the users of the service
  * First they need to Share the Secret
  * Second they need to Prepare the Payload
  * Third they need to Get the Token
  * Fourth they need to Identify the Consumer
