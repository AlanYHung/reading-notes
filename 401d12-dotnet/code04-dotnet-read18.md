### Summary
* ASP.NET Identity is a membership system that adds Login / Logout User Authentication management.
* Three classes are used to represent the identity of a user:
  * Claims - A claim represents a single fact about a user.  I.E. First Name will be a claim and Last Name would be a second claim
  * ClaimsIdentity - An instance of this class would be used in authentication in the form of proving who a user is.  I.E. an instance of this class could stand in as a virtual driver's License in real life which would be a form of identification for the user
  * ClaimsPrincipal - represents the actual user
