### Summary
* Routing is the handling of incoming HTTP requests and dispatching the requests to the correct endpoints in an application.
* In ASP.NET Routing is registered in the middleware pipeline of Startup.Configure.
* Endpoints are something that can be selected via matching url and http methods and then executed via running delegates.
