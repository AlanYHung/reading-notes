### Summary
* Unit Testing is the practice of setting up a framework that tests pieces of your code to ensure that those pieces function as expected.  This will help you in recognizing what types of Exception Handling is needed that may have been missed and/or help with debugging your code for logical type errors that you may not have considered while coding.  
* There are 6 best practices to follow when unit testing:
  1. Arrange, Act, Assert
  1. One Assert Per Test Method
  1. Avoid Test Interdependence
  1. Keep It Short, Sweet, and Visible
  1. Recognize Test Setup Pain as a Smell
  1. Add Them to the Build
* The README is for both consumers and developers alike.  The README is a road map to your program.  It will begin by telling the user how to setup and run your code and end with resource links that can help the user understand your program better.  Along the way the README will let the user know what your program does, what problem your program is solving, and the contents of your program.
* The following is a checklist to help you with constructing a README:

```
    * One-liner explaining the purpose of the module
    * Necessary background context & links
    * Potentially unfamiliar terms link to informative sources
    * Clear, runnable example of usage
    * Installation instructions
    * Extensive API documentation
    * Performs cognitive funneling
    * Caveats and limitations mentioned up-front
    * Doesn't rely on images to relay critical information
    * License
```
