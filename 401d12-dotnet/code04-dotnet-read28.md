### Summary
* A Graph is a data structure that contains a collection of vertices(nodes) and edges.
* Every Node is interconnected to multiple other nodes without limit
* A Graph contains:
  * Vertex - the node
  * Edge - the connections between nodes
  * Neighbor - the direct connecting nodes
  * Degree - number of edges connected to vertex
* A Directed Connection is a single direction connection
* An Undirected Connection is a bidirectional connection
* Complete Graphs are where all nodes are interconnected
* Connected Graphs are where all nodes are at least connected to 1 other node
* Disconnected Graphs are where there are nodes not connected to the main graph
* Acyclic is where a graph is not interconnected so you can reach an endpoint
* Cyclic graph is where all nodes are interconnected and you can run around the graph from any node infinitely.
* Weighted Edges is a number that you can set to represent something like the sides of a triangle.
