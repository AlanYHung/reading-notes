### Summary
* Debugging and Exception Handling are an important part of Coding.  Understanding and having good debugging practices such as using breakpoints and console value printouts are essential to good Coding practices.  This will help you find and resolve issues quicker and more effieciently, and will allow you to reduce the amount of time spent on your program.  Understanding and having good Exception Handling practices will save time down the road when users or other developers may give your program inputs it was not designed to handle.  Handling these exceptions ahead of time will prevent many man hours of tracking down bugs after your code has been launched.  Common Exceptions include Null, OutOfRange, InvalidOperation, NotSupported, NotImplemented, and ObjectDisposed.
* An Example of good Debugging and Exception Handling is the Ariane 5 space vehicle
* An Example of what bad Debugging and Exception Handling is the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine.
