### Summary
* A Hash Table is a Key Value Pair Table that converts the key into a value that can be used by the table to reference a storage location(bucket) for the data.
* An ideal Hash Table is based on O(1) lookup with no collisions
* If collisions exist in a Hash Table they are stored as a list within that memory location
* A Hash Table generally contains the following methods:
  * Hash - converts the key into a storage location address
  * Add - add data to the table
  * Find - Finds and Retrieves data from a table
  * Contains - Checks to see if the value is contained within the table
