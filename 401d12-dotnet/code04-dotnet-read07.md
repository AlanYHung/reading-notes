### Summary
* An interface is similar to an abstract class where every member of the class is abstract and cannot be instantiated.
  * This means that it will tell it's children everything that must be implemented.
* Unlike abstract classes though, you can implement an abstract class and multiple interfaces at the same time.
  * Interfaces can be members of both namespaces and classes
* Interfaces are meant to be a set of guidelines/rules/roadmap for how other classes are setup.
