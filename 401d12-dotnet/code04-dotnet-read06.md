### Summary
* Class inheritance allows you to modify and expand the functionality of existing classes.
* Classes can contain virtual classes that allow developers to override their definition and implementation.
* Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
  * The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common definition base for other classes.
* A Sealed Class prevents derivation, therefore sealed classes cannot be used as a base or abstract class.
* Polymorphism occurs when a derived class is instantiated as the base class.
  * This makes the declared type different than the run-time type
  * Virtual members in the base class is what enables Polymorphism
* Object-Oriented Programming has 4 key techniques:
  1. Abstraction
  1. Encapsulation
  1. Inheritance
  1. Polymorphism
* C# is an Object-Oriented Language
