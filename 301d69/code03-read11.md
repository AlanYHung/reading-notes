* EJS is a way to create a view that a server can run.
  * The view is a file with an extension of __.ejs__ and uses HTML
* response.render can display create a frontend for a server to display
  * You pass to the render function the file without the __.ejs__ extension
  * You can also pass an object into render as a 2nd parameter that can be used by the __.ejs__ file
* Within the __.ejs__ use \<% %> to use inject code functionality into the file.
  * You need an = sign for getting a variable value/evaluating a variable.  i.e. \<%= %>
  * You still need {} for code blocks such as For (loops) and If (conditional) blocks.
