### REST
[Article Source](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)
* Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the web
* Roy Fielding is the one that precisely documented the protocol for getting pages from servers to your browser.
* HTTP is like GPS for the web
* The World wide web is built on an architectural style called __REST__.
* URL's are the representation of a concept that the web can ask for
* Web Services / API's allow computers to use the web the same as users.  Meaning they use the same protocols to pass information back and forth
* URL's are considered nouns for the web
* __Polymorphism__ is a way to say that nouns can have verbs applied to them
* Examples of coding verbs used on nouns are GET, DELETE, and PUT
* So REST is an architectural system that uses nouns and verbs to communicate on the web.
