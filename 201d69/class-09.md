### HTML & CSS
#### Forms (pp. 144-175)
* \<form\> elements allow you to collect information from visitors via a generated form
* Information is collected by forms in name/value pairs
* User Input is collected via form controls which are given names when sent to the server
* HTML5 has increased options for forms which allow a user to fill in forms easier

#### Lists, Tables, & Forms (pp. 330-357)
* list-style-type and list-style image properties allow you to change list marker appearance
* Table Cells can have different borders and spacing depending on the browser used, but it is possible to control and make the appearance more uniform through table property manipulation
* Forms are easier to use if you use CSS to vertically align the controls
* Forms benefit from the styles that give the impression of being more interactive


### JavaScript & JQuery
#### Events (pp. 243-292)
* Events are the way browsers indicate something happening
* Binding is the process of telling the browser which events you are waiting for and the section of the page you would like it to happen in.
* Events can trigger JavaScript functions and makes the page more interactive because it is responding to user input
* Event delegation can be used to monitor for events that can occur for all children of an element
* W3C DOM events are the most commonly used events
