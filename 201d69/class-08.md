* Repeat of Class 04 [Reading 04](/201d69/class-04.md)
* Building Blocks
    1. Block-Level Elements Start on a new line.
    1. Inline Elements flow in between surrounding text.
* Positioning Schemes
    1. Normal Flow
    1. Relative Positioning - moves an element from the normal flow and shifts it top, right, bottom, or left
    1. Absolute Positioning - does not affect the positioning of any of the surrounding elements
    1. Fixed Positioning - places object in relation to browser window over the position of any internal elements
    1. Floating Elements - removes element from normal flow and can be placed to the far left or far right
* Fixed Width Layouts
    * Advantages
        * Pixel values are accurate and controle the size and positioning of the elements
        * Designer has greater control over how a page looks
        * Text line lengths can be controlled
        * An Image size will always stay the same (retains picture quality)
    * Disadvantages
        * Depending the the user's Window, the Page may end up with big gaps around the edges
        * If User resolution is higher, the page will look smaller and may be harder to read
        * If User changes font size, Text may not fit in allotted spaces
        * Page will take up more vertical space than a liquid layout
* Liquid Layouts
    * Advantages
        * Pages expand to fill up the entire browser window
        * The page can adjust itself to the User's Browser/Computer Settings
        * Pages are not affected by User Font Sizes
    * Disadvantages
        * Site may not look as intended in Design based on the settings of the computer/device viewing site
        * Based on user Window Size sentences to become too long or too short, making it hard to read
        * images can end up overflowing into text if the window is smaller than picture size
