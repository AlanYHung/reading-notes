### HTML & CSS
#### Lists (pp. 62-73)
* 3 type of HTML Lists
    1. ordered - uses numbers
        * \<ol\> - creates the ordered list
        * \<li\> - contains a list item
    1. unordered - uses bullets
        * \<ul\> - creates the unordered list
        * \<li\> - contains a list item
    1. definition - used to define terminology
        * \<d1\> - creates the definition list
        * \<dt\> - contains the term
        * \<dd\> - contains the definition
* Lists can be nested under other lists

#### Boxes (pp. 300-329)
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has it's own Box
* CSS can control the following Box properties:
    1. Dimensions
    1. Margin - Outside Borders
    1. Padding - Inside Borders
    1. Borders
* HTML elements can be hidden using display and visibility properties
* Block Line Boxes can be turned into Inline Boxes and Vice Versa
* CSS can control the size of the box to help improve the legibility of internal content
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

### JavaScript & JQuery
#### Arrays (pp. 70-73)
* Arrays are special variables that store a list of values.
* All variables in the array have to be the same type.
* Array indexes start at 0.
* Arrays have a property called .length which returns the number of items in the array.

#### Decisions & Loops (pp. 162-182)
* Continuation of previous class reading [Decision and Loops Section](/201d69/class-02.md)
* Switch statements allow you to compare a value against a list of possible outcomes and has a conditional to deal with cases where value is not on list.
* Data Types can be coerced into another Data Type
