### HTML & CSS
#### Text (pp. 40-61)
* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page.
* 2 Types of Markups
    1. Structural - elements to describe headings and paragraphs
        1. \<h1\> - \<h6\> (6 levels of headings)
        1. \<p\> (paragraphs)
        1. \<b\> (bold)
        1. \<i\> (italicize)
        1. \<sup\> (superscript)
        1. \<sub\> (subscript)
        1. \<br /\> (Line Break/Carriage Return)
        1. \<hr /\> (Page Break)
    1. Semantic - elements used to add extra information. (i.e. where to place emphasis in a sentence)
        1. \<strong\> (indicates strong importance)
        1. \<em\> (emphasis in a sentence to change meaning)
        1. \<blockquote\> (for long quotes around a paragraph or longer)
        1. \<q\> (for short quotes)
        1. \<abbr\> (abbreviation)
        1. \<cite\> (Cite information when referencing from another work)
        1. \<dfn\> (definition)
        1. \<address\> (contains links)
        1. \<ins\> (shows what has been added)
        1. \<del\> (shows what has been removed)
        1. \<s\> (denotes something that is no longer accurate)

#### Introducing CSS (pp. 226-245)
* CSS isolates each HTML element and uses rules to indicate how it should appear
    1. Selectors indicated the elements that rules apply to
    1. Declarations are the rules that indicate how the elements should look.  2 Parts to Declarations:
        1. Properties of elements 
        2. Values of the Properties
* Convention is to put CSS into it's own file "styles.css", however you can include the css within your HTML File as well.

### JavaScript & JQuery
#### Basic JavaScript Instructions (pp. 53-84)
* A script is made up of a series of statements.
    * Each statement is a like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts require very precise instructions in order for the computer to achieve the intended goal.
* Variables are computer allocated memory locations used to store temporary pieces of information used in the script.
* Arrays are variables that combine several memory locations and several pieces of information into 1 variable.
* Type of variables:
    1. Numbers (0-9)
    1. Strings (text)
    1. Boolean (True or False)
* Expressions evaluate into a single value
    * Requires the use of operators for the calculation

#### Decisions and Loops
* There are 3 concepts programmers usually rely on to determine path of script
    1. Evaluations (Determine if result matches expectations)
    1. Decisions (Use results of evaluations to determine path)
    1. Loops (For when a set of steps need to be repeated)
* There are 2 components to a decision:
    1. The result of an evaluated Expression
    1. The conditional statement used to determine path of script
        * Refer to [Code 102 - Reading 08](Operators_and_Loops.md) for operators used in conditional statements such as IF..Then..Else
