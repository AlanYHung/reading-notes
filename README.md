### *Growth Mindset*

#### What Growth Mindset means to me is having an open mind and be willing to learn new things.
* Need to be willing to learn new variations of methods/skills you may already know in order to approach problems from new angles.
* Be proactive in self-learning such as searching for solutions to problems that you are encountering in a Web Browser
* Think of skills that you may need to acquire for future projects
